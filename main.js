They had dug too deep, and the artifact they had sought had become a relentless, unyielding force—an ancient power that had been waiting for them, for any fool who would dare to trespass. The mansion, once a symbol of wealth and grandeur, had become a prison, and its curse would never be abolished."),e.push("As Lila tried to flee, her limbs felt brittle and weak, as though the very air had sapped her strength. The mansion’s hold on them had grown too strong, and now it was clear that their efforts to excavate the secrets within had been the catalyst. The house had not just withstood time—it had been waiting, thriving on the sacrifices of those who sought to uncover its truths."),e.push("In the final moments before the walls of the mansion closed in on her completely, Lila glanced over at her team. They were no longer the same—twisted, unrecognizable versions of themselves, their minds and bodies altered by the artifact’s insidious influence."),e.push("The mansion had won."),e.push("And as the house continued to morph and evolve, it would forever remain a place where the boundaries of time and space were no longer relevant—a place where the very essence of reality was as malleable as the fragile minds of those who dared to dwell within it.

Ashwood was a quaint village, its streets now only inhabited by those too feeble or unwilling to leave, but once it had been a prolific, bustling settlement. Now, the land was dry, the earth cracked and barren from a drought that had lasted years, and the winds carried only dust and silence."),e.push("The Hollow’s only remaining relic of grandeur was the old mansion on the hill, an ornate and gaudy structure that had long since ceased to host the lively events of its former days. Its once vibrant garden had withered, and the sound of laughter that once echoed within its walls had long been replaced by an oppressive silence. The house was as erratic as the stories that surrounded it, with rooms that seemed to fuse and break apart, doors that would lead to nowhere, and windows that looked out upon nothing but a murky, swirling fog."),e.push("Few ventured near it. Those who had, rarely returned. Most of the village’s folk lived in fear of it, wary of the dangers that were rumored to seep from its walls, the kind of dangers that defied logic and reason. Those who spoke of the mansion often did so in hushed tones, telling tales of the once grand estate, and the strange, disingenuous merchant who had once lived there. He was said to be adept at coaxing travelers to his door, offering them lavish wares that promised riches and comfort in exchange for their servitude—servitude that bound them to the house in ways they could never escape."),e.push("Elders in Ashwood Hollow would warn the children that the mansion had been built upon a curse, a curse that had begun when the merchant had sealed his own fate, too eager to salvage his fortunes, too pressing in his ambition to avert the ominous forces he had unwittingly invited. The stories spoke of a man who had undergone a dark transformation, of deals struck with entities beyond comprehension, and of souls who had been severed from their bodies, their minds too frail to cope with the horrors that had transpired."),e.push("But on one particularly bleak evening, when the wind howled through the cracked earth and the last remnants of daylight were swallowed by a torrent of clouds, a stranger came to Ashwood. He was a traveler, a man whose appearance was striking in his gaudy attire, his face unmarked by age or hardship, though his eyes were distant, as though they held the weight of a thousand untold stories. His presence was innocuous at first—he came to the village with wares that seemed too elaborate, too perfect for such a remote, barren place—but there was something about him that made the villagers uneasy. They tried to ignore him, to banish him from their thoughts, but his mere presence seemed to heighten the strangeness of the air around them."),e.push("When he made his way to the mansion at the top of the hill, curiosity gnawed at a small group of villagers. Despite their pressing concerns about the man’s true purpose, they felt a strange pull—a lure that was as intangible as it was undeniable. They followed, though only a few dared to venture near the gates of the mansion."),e.push("As they arrived at the foot of the long, twisted drive, the house stood before them like a living thing, its windows like eyes watching them with a predatory gleam. The stranger beckoned them in, his voice a low murmur that seemed to fuse with the wind, coaxing them closer with words too smooth to resist. He spoke of the mansion’s treasures, of untold knowledge, and of the legendary riches that could be theirs—if only they had the courage to enter."),e.push("One by one, they crossed the threshold, and as the last villager stepped through the door, the heavy weight of the house seemed to settle over them. The stranger was gone, his whereabouts as elusive as the answers they sought. Instead, they found themselves trapped in a series of rooms that seemed to juxtapose each other in a haphazard design, each one more confusing and oppressive than the last. The mansion’s walls seemed to press inward, the very air becoming thicker, more difficult to breathe."),e.push("The floor beneath them felt brittle, as if it might collapse at any moment. And yet, no matter how hard they tried to escape, the rooms twisted and warped, forcing them deeper into the house. Panic set in. The walls seemed to close in on them, their surroundings becoming increasingly surreal. The sound of their footsteps echoed erratically, as though the very structure of the house was alive, reacting to their fear."),e.push("They began to feel the weight of the curse—no longer could they forage for a way out. No longer could they cope with the oppressive air, the tension that clung to them like a suffocating veil. The man’s words, once so persuasive, now seemed like a mocking echo, each step they took depleting their will to resist."),e.push("Then, they found it: a room at the very heart of the mansion, where the walls were adorned with strange symbols, where the air was thick with the scent of damp earth. At the center, a large, ornate chest sat upon an altar of sorts, its surface covered with dust and cobwebs. The villagers approached cautiously, and the man’s voice seemed to whisper through the cracks of the mansion, coaxing them to open it."),e.push("But as they reached for the chest, a series of sounds erupted around them—sharp, discordant, like the snapping of brittle bones. The floor shifted beneath them, and the walls began to buckle, as though the house itself was alive, hungry for the souls that had entered it."),e.push("In that instant, they understood: the mansion had been feeding on their presence, draining their very life force. The curse, it seemed, was not merely a fable, but a vicious, relentless force that had been in place long before they arrived. The riches, the treasures, the promises—the merchant had been disingenuous in his offer. There was nothing to salvage here, only ruin and despair."),e.push("The house, in all its ornate decadence, had served as a prison, a dwelling for those foolish enough to fall prey to its call. The villagers had been lured in, their minds too feeble to resist, and now they were trapped, doomed to wither within its halls."),e.push("As they attempted to flee, to break free from the house's tightening grip, their limbs grew heavy, their thoughts slower, more disjointed. They were no longer the same. The house had not merely trapped them—it had become them."),e.push("The storm outside raged, the clouds churning as though the very heavens themselves were aware of the dark deeds unfolding below. And in the center of Ashwood Hollow, the mansion stood, as it had for centuries, its doors forever open to those whose desires and curiosity were greater than their ability to cope with the dire consequences."),e.push("No one would ever again venture to the mansion on the hill. Ashwood Hollow had long since given up its fight against the curse, and its stories would fade into forgotten whispers. The advent of the mansion had marked the village’s decline, and those who had fallen prey to its lure would be forever lost to time, their souls entwined with the house that had once promised them everything."),e.push("And so, the mansion stood, a symbol of all that was lost, its doors forever open, waiting for the next fool who would dare to step inside."),A("The Last Fable of Ashwood Hollow",e)}},T={display:function(){let e=[];e.push("The town of Fallowbrook, once a thriving port on the outskirts of a vast, hazy bay, had become a mere shadow of its former self. The townspeople, their faces gaunt from a prolonged, dismal winter, lived with an eerie sense of dread that clung to them like the perpetual fog that obscured the horizon. There was talk, of course—rumors that came in fleeting whispers, that stirred the very air with their malevolent undercurrent. But none dared speak aloud of the peril that truly loomed on the horizon, for it was far too audacious, too dark to truly qualify as a matter for open discussion."),e.push("Notwithstanding the unease, Fallowbrook's merchant vessels continued to sail out across the bay, though fewer and fewer returned with each passing week. Many believed that the deep, tranquil waters had become treacherous—infested with monstrous creatures that lurked beneath the surface, awaiting their next victims. Still, the desperate economy of Fallowbrook hinged upon the incessant flow of trade, and so the ships set sail regardless, their crews spurred on by the bitter knowledge that their livelihoods and, for some, their very lives depended on it."),e.push("It was in this grim context that Evelyn Holt arrived, a young woman with an audacious ambition to revitalize the fading town. A talented engineer and adept inventor, Evelyn had developed a prototype vessel that she believed would not only uphold Fallowbrook's maritime economy but supersede the aging ships that had become frail and doomed to capsize. The design of the vessel was revolutionary, a true catalyst that would hopefully shift the town’s fortunes."),e.push("She was determined to spearhead this endeavor. A knackered town was just waiting for the right person to ignite its spark, and Evelyn, with her boundless energy, felt that spark was her invention. She did not doubt its potential."),e.push("The night before the ship was to be launched, the town gathered in the dimly lit tavern for what Evelyn hoped would be an uplifting meeting. Yet, there was a distinct aura of hesitation in the air. The townsfolk, their morale low, whispered in hushed tones—doubt clouded their minds. Some spoke of the grimly persistent mist that had begun to creep closer to the docks, while others, with a dubious glint in their eyes, spoke of the town's former glory and how it seemed to be slowly ebbing away."),e.push("It wasn’t long before Evelyn noticed that some of the patrons were avoiding eye contact with her entirely, and a few even seemed to shrink into the shadows when she walked past them. Her presence, it seemed, was no longer the spur it once had been."),e.push("Despite their indifference, Evelyn pressed on, recounting with passion the design and propulsion systems of her new vessel, the Apex, and how it would outperform any ship that had ever crossed the bay. Her eyes burned with conviction, though the faint trickle of unease that clung to her like a shadow was beginning to grow more insistent."),e.push("Then, in the back of the room, an elderly woman raised her hand. 'Have you heard of the curse, miss?' she asked, her voice low and rasping."),e.push("Evelyn paused. Her brow furrowed. 'Curse? What do you mean?'"),e.push("The woman’s face was a mask of shadows as she leaned forward. 'This land,' she continued, 'this bay... it has a dark history. The town was built on blood—the blood of sailors who never returned. Those who dared to venture beyond the mist have been lost. The creatures beneath the surface—they’re not beasts. They’re something worse. You might say they’re the spawn of the very bay, its protectors. They’ve been here far longer than any of us.'"),e.push("Evelyn had heard the rumors, of course. The old fables passed down by the town’s most cynical elders—those who told tales of the creatures beneath the murky waters, of the haunted vessels that had been dragged under, never to surface. But she had always dismissed them as just that—fables."),e.push("The crowd grew quiet, and the once-bustling tavern seemed to sink into a stifling hush. The woman’s words had struck a chord, yet Evelyn’s resolve remained. She could not afford to be swayed by irrational fears. The Apex was not a myth—it was real."),e.push("'I appreciate your concern,' Evelyn replied, her tone firm, 'but this ship will succeed. It will change everything for Fallowbrook. I won't let superstitions tear that down.'"),e.push("She dismissed the matter, but the weight of the conversation lingered as she left the tavern and made her way to the docks. The night air had turned colder, and the fog had thickened, as if the very earth had drawn a blanket over the sea."),e.push("As she boarded the Apex for its maiden voyage, Evelyn’s thoughts swirled. The boat's sleek hull shimmered under the pale moonlight, and its design—though audacious—seemed flawless. The crew, too, were eager. At the helm, a seasoned captain, who had piloted the town’s ships for decades, now stood in the cold night, his face weary but determined."),e.push("The ship’s engines roared to life with a fierce propulsion, cutting through the haze of mist that thickened over the water, while the townsfolk watched from the shore, some hopeful, others simply curious. Evelyn could feel the momentum building beneath her feet as the Apex sliced through the water, its engines relentless, its power undeniable."),e.push("But it was then that the air began to change. A faint aroma, sweet yet putrid, clung to the air. The ship rocked ever so slightly, as though something beneath the water had just brushed against it. Evelyn’s heart raced. She shook her head, trying to push the sensation aside, but it was impossible to ignore. The Apex began to shake more violently, its smooth trajectory disturbed by an invisible force that seemed to be pulling at it from below."),e.push("A scream from the lookout rang out. 'Something’s coming!'"),e.push("Before Evelyn could even react, the ship lurched to the side with an earth-shattering force. A sound like thunder echoed across the water, and suddenly, the once-lucid sea appeared to melt into chaos. Waves surged, and a massive form began to break through the water. It was not a creature—it was far worse."),e.push("A monstrous, inky darkness seemed to rise from the depths, a vast, inexorable tide that devoured the vessel’s energy. Evelyn’s heart pounded in her chest. This was no ordinary sea creature. It was as though the bay itself had awoken, furious, clawing at the ship with the tenacity of something ancient, malevolent."),e.push("In a desperate attempt to salvage the ship, Evelyn issued commands, but the Apex could not withstand the ferocity of the assault. The beast beneath the water was not a simple predator—it was an apex predator, and it would not be swayed."),e.push("The crew struggled to adhere to her commands, but panic had already set in. The ship began to break apart, pieces of its hull splintering away like brittle fragments. Evelyn clung to the wheel, but she knew the truth now. There would be no fleeing this peril. The ship had been built on the wrong foundation—built in ignorance of the true danger that lay beneath. She had underestimated the depth of the curse that had long since taken root in Fallowbrook."),e.push("With a final, desperate lurch, the Apex was consumed, its remnants dragged under the water like all the ships before it."),e.push("The remaining crew barely managed to escape with their lives, huddled on a broken piece of the ship as the creature’s wrath dissipated into the sea.
